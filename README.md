# Customer-Behaviour-in-Super-Market-using-Netlogo
 This project presents a customer behavioral model for grounding the number of purchase items in Agent-Based In-Store Simulator (ABISS).  Using ABISS, we are able to virtually investigate the shopping paths of the customers and analyze the effect of sales promotion. Then we developed a decision model, which determined customers’ “Shopping List”, “Possession Money Limit”, and “Staying time”.
